#Cocos2dx UIKit integration

This is an example of how to integrate iOS UIKit with Cocos2d-x

Added [SWRevealViewController](https://github.com/John-Lluch/SWRevealViewController) as main navigation controller.   
This project is built with Xcode 6.4 and Cocos2d-x v3.8 (with some [minor modifications](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13816)).  
  
**Note:** Only demostrates how to integrate UIKit, has no support for device orientation , built for iOS only all other platforms where disabled/removed.
